# Advent of Code 2023 Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 problems. Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles throughout the month of December.

Visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/) to learn more about the event.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, one for each day of the event. Each folder contains the solution code for the corresponding day's problem. Additionally, there may be input files or any other resources required for the solutions.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you'll need a compatible programming language and environment. Each solution is provided as a separate file, so you can choose to run them individually or all at once.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Glenn-Mendonca/AdventOfCode2023.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's folder:

   ```shell
   cd AdventOfCode2023/dayX
   ```

3. Run the solution code:

   I have used MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1 compiler for C++ solutions. You can use any compatible compiler for your system.

   ```shell
   g++ -o dayX/QY dayX/QY.cpp
   ./dayX/QY
   ```

   where X is the day number and Y is the question part number.
